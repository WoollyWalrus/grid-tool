# Grid set tools

Two web pages for Grid 3 grid sets. Both run entirely in your web browser: nothing is
uploaded.

- **Grid set Shrinker** (`index.html`) makes grid sets smaller by shrinking the
  pictures inside them, so large grid sets stop lagging on devices.
- **Grid set Spell Checker** (`spellcheck.html`) finds spelling mistakes and lets you
  correct them. See [Spell Checker](#spell-checker) below.

## Grid set Shrinker

- **Only pictures change.** Grids, text, symbols, sounds and settings are copied
  across exactly as they were.
- **Pictures look the same.** Every shrunk picture is checked against the original,
  and if it would look different the original is kept.
- **Nothing is uploaded.** It all runs in your web browser, on your computer.

Typical result: a 46 MB grid set becomes 12.5 MB.

## Using it

1. Export the grid set from Grid 3 as a `.gridset` file.
2. Open the Grid set Shrinker page and drag the file onto it.
3. Click **Download smaller grid set** when it finishes.
4. Import the smaller grid set into Grid 3 and check it on a device before sharing it.

Licensed grid sets, usually `.gridsetx`, can't be shrunk. Choose a grid set that
does not require a licence.

It's safe to shrink a grid set more than once, or one built from pages of grid sets
that were already shrunk. Pictures that have been shrunk before are always left
exactly as they are.

## Spell Checker

1. Export the grid set from Grid 3 and drag it onto the **Check spelling** page.
2. Each unknown word is listed once, with how often and where it appears and an
   example of the text around it. Choose a suggestion, type a correction, or select
   **Accept**. **Show where** lists every place, and you can untick places to leave alone.
3. Click **Download corrected grid set** and import it into Grid 3.

It checks the words on cells, the text cells write and speak, word lists, audio
descriptions and tooltips, using British English. Each place is labelled with which
kind of text it is. Page names are checked too, but only reported, because other pages
link to them by name. Rename those in Grid 3.

Accepted words are saved in that web browser. **Export list** and **Import list** move
them between computers or colleagues as a plain text file, one word per line. Words
that every CandLE grid uses can be added for everyone in `BUILT_IN_WORDS` at the top
of `assets/js/spell.mjs`.

Only the corrected words change: the rest of the file stays byte for byte the same.

## Running it on your own computer

The page needs a small local web server; opening `index.html` directly won't work.

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open <http://localhost:8000>.

## Making changes

- **How-to section and FAQ:** edit the marked block in `index.html`. Put screenshots
  in `assets/img/`.
- **Colours and fonts:** `assets/css/style.css`.
- **Quality limits:** `QUALITY` at the top of `assets/js/shrink.mjs`.
- **Words the spell checker always allows:** `BUILT_IN_WORDS` in `assets/js/spell.mjs`.

Changes go in through a pull request to `main`. Once merged, GitHub Pages updates
the live site automatically within a minute or two. There is no build step.

## Testing

Needs Node 20+ and Python 3 with Pillow and NumPy.

```sh
# Shrink a grid set using the same code as the web page
node tests/shrink-node.mjs original.gridset shrunk.gridset

# Independently check that only pictures changed and nothing is broken
python3 tests/verify.py original.gridset shrunk.gridset
```

```sh
# Spell checker: synthetic checks, list the words flagged in a grid set,
# and independently check a corrected grid set
node tests/spell-regressions.mjs
node tests/spell-node.mjs original.gridset --suggest
python3 tests/verify-spelling.py original.gridset corrected.gridset
```

More detail, and a tool for checking a grid set that has been through Grid 3, is in
[`tests/README.md`](tests/README.md).

Never commit real grid sets: they contain lesson content. `.gitignore` blocks them.

## How it works

Each picture is tried three ways, and the smallest version that passes the
"looks the same" check is kept:

| Method | What it does | Library |
|---|---|---|
| Lossless | Stores the same pixels more efficiently | oxipng |
| Fewer colours | Reduces to a 256-colour palette | libimagequant |
| Photo compression | Saves as JPEG (only pictures with no transparency) | MozJPEG |

The "looks the same" check compares sharpness (SSIM) and colour (ΔE). Pictures with
transparency are compared on both white and black backgrounds, and see-through parts
must stay see-through. If a picture can't be made at least 5% smaller, it isn't
changed.

Every shrunk picture gets a small hidden tag, so it is never processed again. This
stops quality dropping when pages are copied between grid sets and shrunk repeatedly.
Grid 3 keeps the tag when pages are copied (tested).

File names never change. Grid 3 reads pictures by their content, so a `.png` file
can safely contain JPEG data. Grid already does this itself.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `index.html`, `assets/css/` | The page |
| `assets/js/app.js` | Page logic; runs several pictures at once in the background |
| `assets/js/shrink.mjs` | Picture shrinking and the "looks the same" check |
| `assets/js/core.js` | Reading and writing grid sets; rejects licensed ones |
| `spellcheck.html`, `assets/js/spellcheck.js` | The spell checker page |
| `assets/js/gridtext.mjs` | Finding the words in each page and changing them in place |
| `assets/js/spell.mjs`, `assets/js/spell-worker.mjs` | Dictionary checks, run in the background |
| `assets/vendor/` | Third-party libraries, stored locally |
| `tests/` | Test and checking scripts |

## Licence

GNU GPL v3 (see `LICENSE`), because the libimagequant library is GPL-3.0. If the code
ever needs to be kept private and the tool offered outside CandLE, swap libimagequant
for an MIT-licensed library such as `image-q`, or buy a commercial libimagequant
licence.
